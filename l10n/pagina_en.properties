paginae/quest/eatdrink=All this shifting about has made you hungry, and your stomach growls to remind you that you should probably acquire some food and drink before you starve. Whenever you perform laborious tasks your energy meter depletes to refill your stamina meter. You can refill your energy by eating, and you can speed up stamina regeneration from energy by drinking water.

paginae/skills/ahusb=$i{"Harnessed by the Old Gods,\nThe Urox plowed across the skies,\nThe furrow of time."}\n\nYou have had enough close encounters with various beasts of the Wild Hearth that the thought of taming some of them has entered your mind. You may snare and keep tamable beasts, as well as construct coops, troughs, and hitching posts.\n\nTo tame a wild, tamable, animal: \nFirst, lure it to you with clover.\nThen snare it with a rope.\nThen tie it to a hitching post.\nThen, when soon it stands ready to fight,\nDefeat it in combat again, and again,\nBut when it yields to you, yield to it,\nAnd hurt it no further,\nUntil its beast has been quelled.

The truly rare fish of the world are caught with rods.
paginae/skills/forage=$i{"Full in her pride she stood,\nBlossoming through spring and autumn,\nWild with fruit and harvest-flowers."}\n\nYou know a thing or two about the wild plants of the land, and can see and pick a lot of them if you find them.

Beware that some fell beasts of the wilds will kill and eat you, and that you might not be a competent enough fighter yet to take them on. Start out small, with Ants, and build your skills, before going for bigger prey.\n\nSome small animals, like Rabbits and Frogs, can be picked up without a fight, if you can catch them.

paginae/skills/lawspeaking = $i{"Where there was strife, let there be kinship.\nWhere there was hunger, let there be bread.\nWhere, yesteryear, pyres burned, let there be law."}\n\nThe Lawspeaker's position is held in high regard by traditional Hearthling society.

paginae/skills/rage = $i{"Insults fell on his mind,\nLike sparks on wet leaves,\nUntil the leaves, one day, were dry.}\n\nYou've had quite enough, and someone is going to get it hard and fast.

paginae/skills/ropetwin=$i{"One over one,\nHe drew round over round,\nTwinning rope from golden strands"}\n\nYou can construct and use a Rope Walk to stretch, twine, and tie ropes.

Breed Silkmoths, set their eggs on herbalist tables, feed the worms mulberry leaves, and unravel the cocoons.
paginae/skills/srv = $i{"Kodving broke the ice,\nSkarm drew him up,\nLogi saved them both."}\n\nThey say that the burning longings in the back of every Hearthling's mind are the ancient lores of Firemaking, and of Walking the Land & Wild. Any Hearthling who has passed through the Evergreen, and been burned into the world, knows how to build fire and shelter, provided she finds the right materials.
paginae/skills/steelmaking=$i{"Born in flame,\nYet cold and silent,\nThirsting for blood.\nWho am I?"}\n\nThe embers of your forge have run glowing red hot, and from them now spring the strangest, most wonderful materials.

paginae/skills/swim=$i{"Nine drops of rain-water,\nHe carried,\nOver land and black seas."}\n\nYou know how to get yourself out on deep water, which unfortunately carries with it the risk of never getting back alive to the shallows again.

paginae/skills/tools = $i{"Fashioned alone,\nBy fire at night,\nWith fire in mind,\nThree Ashen staves."}\n\nThey say that some mysterious forms are eternal lodestars written into the firmament of the Hearth. You think you could make a Stone Axe for yourself if you found the right materials.

You may construct stone columns to support your mining operations, and you find better ores when mining.
paginae/skills/vandal = $i{"The Skarm was forded by the late solstice,\nThe Heiskarl brought two by six ships.\nThe city was sacked.}\n\nSomething deep inside of you has begun yearning to see the world burn. You may destroy objects, and otherwise perform deleterious actions, on claims, without permission. \n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down -- and that being an outlaw prevents your character from being logged out for some time after the offense.

paginae/skills/winemaking=$i{"In autumn vineyards,\nDrunk with song and laughter,\nAnd bittersweet juice,\nRed with love and promise."}\n\nYou know a good vintage when you taste one, and also how to grow grapes and press them, to actually make wine.

paginae/skills/woodsmanship=$i{"In the depth of winter,\nLie hidden away,\nAlong secret trails,\nThe seeds of spring."}\n\nYou have walked the wilds for some time, and know your way around them. You have greater success when planting trees.
paginae/skills/wzm=$i{"Wicked portents,\nA black ash dripping with blood.\nAnd the entrails whisper\nOf lies and deceit."}\n\nYou have begun yearning for something... more. The Will to Power is the first step on the left-hand path of domination, and it is not without consequence.
paginae/skills/yeomanry=$i{"Kolbjorn first broke the land around the Veitvast,\nHis family now sits in unbroken line by that water,\nTheir Halls ringing with mead and laughter."}\n\nYou have made enough of an impact upon the world to begin thinking of some certain parts of it as being your own. You may construct Claim Poles, and begin claiming private plots of land around them.
paginae/skills/yrkir/blacksmith = Metal chimes in pure notes at the thunder of your hammer, and your muscles have grown to terrible dimensions enough to bend steel. Your life is lived and regulated by the steady, pulsating rhythm of pounding hammers, and heaving bellows, drawing the heavy sighs of hot, soot-filled, air, rushing again away to feed ever hungry, ever burning, furnaces, mirrored in reflective pools of molten metal. You know the stuff which makes up all the Hearth -- earth and wood -- and how to slake their thirsts for metallic forms in the glowing fury of white-hot flames. The Firmament of the Hearth was pounded thin as a flake, and hung high over the Hearth, by the Creator, from a single silver nugget. Pounding the Blacksmith's Anvil promises...\n$col[255,255,0]{\n • Strength +15 & Smithing +15\n • Small quality bonus to all fuel added to Smelters and Finery Forges.\n • Higher chance to increase quality when pounding Wrought Iron.\n • Small quality bonus when smithing.\n • Small chance to double output when smithing.}
paginae/skills/yrkir/cavehermit = The surface of the Hearth has grown but a distant memory, and the waves of history may wash whichever ways they please, far above in that raging, tumultous world of light and day. Your world has become another, calmer, darker, deeper, and more ancient one, of peace and meditation, far below in the cool and pitch of the deepest caverns, where Hearthling sight fades, and other senses grow instead to terrible powers. You spend your nights eternal far down, down near the roots of the Mountain, in the musk of cavebulbs, with a touch of slime, and the haunting symphonies of a thousand bats screeching in awful symphony. Your ways are those of stone, and of thought, and of communion, ultimately, with the dark of the cavernous Underworld. Staring into the Cave Hermit's Abyss promises...\n$col[255,255,0]{\n • Significantly increased risk of mining out trolls.\n • Ability to eat Stalagooms & Cave Slime.\n • +3% study speed per cave level you descend.\n • Deal 5% extra damage per cave level you descend.\n • Trolls no longer attack you.}

paginae/skills/yrkir/farmer1 = Your thoughts now graze on greener pastures, from the planting of peas, to all the proper ways to weed the wheat. You once grew a carrot to the shape of your own heart.
paginae/skills/yrkir/farmer2 = You move like a tending cabbage worm through fields and plantings, and, everywhere you go, life around you quietly serenades the green of your fingers.
paginae/skills/yrkir/farmer3 = The wild of nature has, in your caring hands, grown tame and opulent, rich and wasteful in form and expression. You grow beets the size of a manly fist, and cabbages the size of a head full of farmer's wisdom, not unlike your own.
paginae/skills/yrkir/farmer4 = You know nearly all there is to know about the ways of a farmer, save, perhaps, the sacred tongue of worms, spoken in slithers wherever life returns to mulch, and then to life anew. The flowers strew a path of petals wherever you wander.
paginae/skills/yrkir/farmer = In golden rows, ever chasing a blue horizon, lie planted the myths of a people tied intimately to the soil they till, and to the grain they mill. Of such things you desire to learn more, for you are becoming a Farmer, and within you now shoots leaves of wisdom, of the seasons, and of the plants, and of all the things which grow.

Day and night have begun losing their meanings to you, and your senses have grown acutely tuned to a life subterranean. You live every moment to go deeper and further down, down toward deep and deeper veins, where the roots of the mountain claw their way into the Underworld, and where the caverns echo with trollish laughter. With every snapping of the tendons, and every strain of muscles aching, you drive your pick through the eternal cavern, ripping the treasures of the deep to that surface far above which you so seldom see, and hoping to strike for the Mother Lode.

For Peasant and King alike, only the Tailor stands between him, the cold of the seasons, and the harshness of unforgiving elements, and such responsibilities call forth only the best in those whose task it is to wear that spiritual finery.
